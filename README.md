V1

* UPDATED 09-07-2014

Orginal work of: Russell Harrower

v1 is the first public release of MogoCMS - designed and coded using open source code from RediMongo, and other open source projects.

MogoCMS which from now on will be refered to as Mogo is a blog/website software that users are able to use with MongoDB

This script has been a work in progress from the v3 release of RediMongo which was also created and coded by Russell Harrower - We changed the name as we wanted to be more hip.

HISTORY OF MOGO
==
Mogo was orginally named RediMongo in 2012 and was created for Telco company who was developing an eftpos cash back system in 2012/2013.
Version 2 of RediMongo was designed for a radio station.

It changed its name **OFFICALLY** on the 19-10-2014 to Mogo this version is all newly coded and as you will be able to see is coded from scratch.

* The main template is coded for russellharrower.com and I personally will be using Mogo for my blog.
